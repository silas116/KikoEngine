Integrate keyboard and mouse input (GLFW supports this).
Create an InputManager to handle key states.
Implement basic camera movement using WASD & mouse.
ðŸ”¹ 3. Logging System
Create a Logger class for debugging.
Use std::cout or a logging library like spdlog.
ðŸ”¹ 4. Window Resizing & Callbacks
Handle window resizing properly.
Set up OpenGL viewport adjustments.
Phase 2: Graphics & Rendering
ðŸ”¹ 5. Graphics Abstraction
Implement a Renderer class to handle rendering calls.
Abstract OpenGL commands into functions.
ðŸ”¹ 6. Shader System
Load & compile GLSL shaders from files.
Create a Shader class for easy use (compilation, binding, setting uniforms).
ðŸ”¹ 7. Basic 2D/3D Rendering
Create a Mesh class to handle vertex buffers.
Render a simple triangle or quad using VAOs & VBOs.
Load & display a texture.



ðŸ”¹ 8. Camera System
Implement a Camera class (with perspective & orthographic options).
Add movement & rotation (FPS-style or orbit camera).
Phase 3: Asset Management
ðŸ”¹ 9. Texture Loading
Use stb_image.h to load textures.
Implement a Texture class.
ðŸ”¹ 10. Model Loading
Use Assimp to load .obj and .fbx models.
Implement a Model class that handles mesh & textures.
ðŸ”¹ 11. Resource Management
Create a ResourceManager for caching assets (textures, models, shaders).
Implement lazy loading to avoid duplicate asset loads.
Phase 4: Game Features
ðŸ”¹ 12. Scene System
Create a Scene class that manages objects & updates them.
Implement a GameObject base class.
ðŸ”¹ 13. Component System (ECS or Simple)
Implement a component-based system (e.g., Transform, Renderable, Physics).
Optionally, use an Entity Component System (ECS) for better scalability.
ðŸ”¹ 14. Physics Engine
Integrate Bullet Physics or write a simple physics engine.
Add collision detection & response.
Phase 5: Advanced Rendering & Effects
ðŸ”¹ 15. Lighting System
Implement basic Phong lighting (ambient, diffuse, specular).
Add support for directional, point, and spotlights.
ðŸ”¹ 16. Post-Processing
Implement a framebuffer system.
Add effects like bloom, motion blur, or HDR.
ðŸ”¹ 17. Particle System

Optimize rendering with batching.
ðŸ”¹ 19. Scripting System
Integrate a scripting language (Lua or Python).
Allow game logic to be written outside of C++.
ðŸ”¹ 20. Engine UI
Use Dear ImGui for debugging & tools.
Add an inspector panel for real-time object editing.
Final Phase: Packaging & Usability
ðŸ”¹ 21. Game Loop & Scene Management
Implement Start, Pause, Resume, and Quit functionality.
Save & load scenes from files.
ðŸ”¹ 22. Asset Pipeline

ðŸ”¹ 23. Build System & Deployment
Optimize the build system for distribution.
Package everything into an executable.
